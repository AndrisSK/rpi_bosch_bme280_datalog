# rpi_bosch_bme280_datalog
Python program interfaceing Bosch BME280 environmental sensor from raspberry pi using python3-smbus library. The script reads atmospheric pressure, humidity and temperature from the sensor, prints the values and exits.

Future work:

    create documentations on how to use the software with raspberry pi
    cleanup the code - Fix programmers misdeeds etc.
    extend the code to log data to file or database
    implement ways how to present the data (web server running on raspberry pi (charts and stuff) or smartphone application connected through bluetooth)
    control air humidifier using raspberry pi? (if feasible)
